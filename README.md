# React Firebase App

This is a React application that uses Firebase for authentication, Firestore database, and Firebase Hosting. This app demonstrates how to integrate Firebase services into a React project.

## Features

- Firebase Authentication (sign-up and login)
- Firestore Database to store and retrieve notes
- Firebase Hosting for deploying the app

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account to use Firebase services. [Sign up for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-firebase-app.git
   cd react-firebase-app
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up Firebase configuration:
   - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    - Set up Firebase Authentication (email/password sign-in).
    - Create a Firestore database and set security rules.
    - Obtain Firebase config details (API key, Auth domain, etc.) from the Firebase Console.
4. Configure Firebase in your React project:
    - Create a firebase.js file in the src directory.
    - Add your Firebase config (copy from the Firebase Console) to firebase.js:\
    ```bash
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
    import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

    const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const db = getFirestore(app);

    export { auth, db };
    ```
5. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    This will run the React app in development mode, and you can access it at http://localhost:3000.

## Firebase Setup
1. **Create Firebase Project:**

    - Go to Firebase Console.
    - Click Add Project, follow the steps to create a new Firebase project.

2. **Enable Firebase Authentication:**

    - In the Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method.
    - Enable Email/Password authentication.

3. **Create Firestore Database:**

    - Go to Firestore Database in Firebase Console.
    - Create a Firestore database and set security rules as needed.

4. **Deploy Firebase Hosting (optional, for deployment):**

    - Set up Firebase Hosting by running firebase init in your terminal (choose Firebase Hosting and follow the prompts).
    - Ensure your React app is built and ready for deployment by running npm run build.
    - Deploy using firebase deploy.

## Running the Application Locally

1. To run the app locally, first build your app:
    ```bash
    npm run build

2. Then start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start

3. Visit your app in the browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Deploying to Firebase Hosting
1. **Install Firebase CLI**: Install the Firebase CLI globally if you haven't already:
    ```
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
2. **Login to Firebase**: Use the Firebase CLI to log in to your Firebase account:
    ```
    firebase login

3. **Initialize Firebase**: Initialize Firebase Hosting in your project:
    ```
    firebase init 
    ```
    - Select Hosting from the list.
    - Choose your Firebase project.
    - Set build as the public directory (React's production build folder).
    - Choose Yes for single-page app.

4. **Deploy the App**: Deploy your app to Firebase Hosting:
    ```
    firebase deploy
    ```
5. After the deployment is complete, Firebase will give you a URL where your app is hosted.
